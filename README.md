I've been studying polyrhythms in music, and noticed some relationships between
them and musical intervals.  For example, in the Greek Just Temperament system,
the interval of a perfect 5th is the ratio of frequencies 3/2.  There is a also
a 3:2 polyrhythm "pass the ketchup":

    3:2 x-----x-----x-----x-----x-----x-----x
    1:1 x--------x--------x--------x--------x
    pass the ketchup  pass the ketchup

So this is a "perfect fifth" polyrhythm.  If we take the faster rhythm and
overlay another 3:2 on top, we get 9:4.  And taking every other note, dividing
it in half, we get 9:8, which is a major second in the greek system.

    9:8 x-------x-------x-------x-------x----    
    9:4 x---x---x---x---x---x---x---x---x---x
    3:2 x-----x-----x-----x-----x-----x-----x
    1:1 x--------x--------x--------x--------x

So that's pretty fun.  All the musical intervals have polyrhythms associated
with them, and playing them all together we can get "rhythmic chords".  For
example, the 1:1, 3:2, and 9:8 together form a rhythm corresponding to a "sus2"
chord.  Polyrhythms for most of the musical ideas in modern music are quite
complex and would take a lot of training to learn to hear as music, but I think
it is possible.

ANYWAY it struck me that colors are also just frequencies, like rhythms and
tones, so we could make "color chords" in an exactly analogous way.  I wanted to
see what that looked like, so I made this tool.
